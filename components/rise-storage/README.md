# Rise Storage Web Component

## Introduction

The Rise Storage Web Component uses Googleâ€™s Storage API to retrieve the URL of a file, or the URLs of all files within a folder, from Rise Storage. If the Rise Cache application is running, it will be utilized for local storage of the files, and the URLs returned by the web component will point to Rise Cache. Otherwise, if Rise Cache is not running, the browser's cache will be utilized.

Single files are only downloaded once and are not subsequently checked for changes. Folders are monitored for changes, but a minimum refresh time of 15 minutes is enforced.

Rise Storage Web Component works in conjunction with [Rise Vision](http://www.risevision.com), the [digital signage management application](http://rva.risevision.com/) that runs on [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com).

At this time Chrome is the only browser that this project and Rise Vision supports.

###Usage
To use the Rise Storage Web Component, you should first install `webcomponents.js`. The `webcomponents.js` polyfills enable Web Components in (evergreen) browsers that lack native support.

To install with Bower:
```
bower install webcomponentsjs
```

To install with npm:
```
npm install webcomponents.js
```

Next, install the Rise Storage Web Component with Bower:
```
bower install rise-storage
```

Finally, construct your HTML page. You should include `webcomponents.js` before any code that touches the DOM, and load the web component using an HTML Import. For example:
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <script src="bower_components/webcomponentsjs/webcomponents.js"></script>
    <link rel="import" href="bower_components/web-component-rise-storage/rise-storage/rise-storage.html">
  </head>
  <body>
    <rise-storage
      companyId="my-company-id"
      folder="my-folder"
      fileName="my-image.png"
      folderRefresh="60"></rise-storage>

    <script>
      // Wait for 'polymer-ready'. Ensures the element is upgraded.
      window.addEventListener('polymer-ready', function(e) {
        var storage = document.querySelector('rise-storage');

        // Respond to events it fires.
        storage.addEventListener('rise-storage-response', function(e) {
          console.log(e.detail[0]); // URL to the file.
        });

        storage.go(); // Call its API methods.
      });
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Built With
- [Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.org)
- [Bower](http://bower.io/)
- [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/)
- [Mocha](http://mochajs.org/), [Chai](http://chaijs.com/) and [web-component-tester](https://github.com/Polymer/web-component-tester) for testing

## Development

### Dependencies
* [Git](http://git-scm.com/) - Git is a free and open source distributed version control system that is used to manage our source code on Github.
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.org/) & [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) - npm is the default package manager for Node.js. npm runs through the command line and manages dependencies for an application. These dependencies are listed in the _package.json_ file.
* [Bower](http://bower.io/) - Bower is a package manager for Javascript libraries and frameworks. All third-party Javascript dependencies are listed in the _bower.json_ file.
* [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) - Gulp is a Javascript task runner. It lints, runs unit and E2E (end-to-end) tests, minimizes files, etc. Gulp tasks are defined in _gulpfile.js_.

### Local Development Environment Setup and Installation
To make changes to the web component, you'll first need to install the dependencies:

- [Git](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
- [Node.js and npm](http://blog.nodeknockout.com/post/65463770933/how-to-install-node-js-and-npm)
- [Bower](http://bower.io/#install-bower) - To install Bower, run the following command in Terminal: `npm install -g bower`. Should you encounter any errors, try running the following command instead: `sudo npm install -g bower`.
- [Gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md) - To install Gulp, run the following command in Terminal: `npm install -g gulp`. Should you encounter any errors, try running the following command instead: `sudo npm install -g gulp`.

The web components can now be installed by executing the following commands in Terminal:
```
git clone https://github.com/Rise-Vision/web-component-rise-storage.git
cd web-component-rise-storage
npm install
bower install
```

### Run Locally
You can access the `demo.html` file via a local web server. On Mac, execute the following command from the root directory of the web component:
```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

This starts a web server on port 8000, and you can access the Rise Storage web component by navigating to `localhost:8000/demo.html`.

### Testing
You can run the suite of tests via a local web server. On Mac, execute the following command from the root directory of the web component:
```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

This starts a web server on port 8000, and you can run the tests by navigating to `http://localhost:8000/test/index.html`.

### Deployment
Once you are satisifed with your changes, deploy the `components` and `rise-storage` folders to your server. You can then use the web component by following the *Usage* instructions.
